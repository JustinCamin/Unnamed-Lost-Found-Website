Design and code a fully functional lost-and-found website for your school community. The
site should help students and staff report found items, search for lost belongings, and manage
the claim process efficiently.
Your website must include:
• A home page with a clear layout and navigation menu
• A submission form for reporting found items, including the ability to upload photos
• A searchable listing of all found items
• A claim/inquiry form for students to request information about or claim a listed item
• A basic backend system or admin view to review, approve, or manage item postings
```
